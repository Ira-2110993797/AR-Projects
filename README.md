# AR-Projects

Augmented Reality (AR) combines digital content with the physical world to improve the user's perception and engagement with their surroundings. AR produces immersive experiences by superimposing computer-generated visuals, sounds, and other sensory inputs onto the physical world, which can then be accessible via devices such as smartphones, tablets, and AR glasses. This technology has numerous applications, including entertainment and gaming, education, healthcare, and industrial maintenance. In retail, AR enables buyers to visualise things in their own environment before making a purchase. In education, it creates interactive learning experiences that make complex subjects more accessible. As AR technology advances, it promises to alter how we interact with both the digital and real worlds, creating new opportunities for communication, productivity, and creativity.



# Uses of AR
Augmented Reality (AR) has a wide range of applications across various fields, enhancing both professional and everyday experiences. Here are some notable uses:

# Entertainment and Gaming: 
AR games, such as Pok√©mon Go, combine virtual aspects with real-world locations to provide engaging gaming experiences. AR may also improve live performances and events by incorporating interactive features.

# Retail:
Customers can use augmented reality to visualise things in their own space before purchasing. For example, furniture merchants such as IKEA employ augmented reality apps to show customers how a piece of furniture would appear and fit in their home.
