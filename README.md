# AR-Projects

Augmented Reality (AR) combines digital content with the physical world to improve the user's perception and engagement with their surroundings. AR produces immersive experiences by superimposing computer-generated visuals, sounds, and other sensory inputs onto the physical world, which can then be accessible via devices such as smartphones, tablets, and AR glasses. This technology has numerous applications, including entertainment and gaming, education, healthcare, and industrial maintenance. In retail, AR enables buyers to visualise things in their own environment before making a purchase. In education, it creates interactive learning experiences that make complex subjects more accessible. As AR technology advances, it promises to alter how we interact with both the digital and real worlds, creating new opportunities for communication, productivity, and creativity.
